Although the majority of school-going children always go to learning institutions within their environs for convenience and accessibility, others do not stay within walking distance. In some instances, parents of students that reside far from their school’s do not have reliable means of dropping their children to their learning institutions or are too committed in their professional lives. Due to these challenges, it might not be easy for some parents to pick or drop their children to schools regularly. For safe and convenient dropping and picking of children, teachers, parents, and leaders within ISD181 school district should jointly develop a secure transport system for their school. A negotiated tactic led by teachers and involving all other stakeholders such as parents, security personnel, children welfare groups, and community leaders can help in creating a jointly supported strategy. Despite walking to school increasing children’s independence and improving their level of maturity, safety concerns necessitate the need for the creation of school transport. The provision of transport for children within the ISD181 school district is essential for enabling their safe movement to schools and back to their homes, as well as for creating the opportunity for those from low-income families to participate in important after-school programs.
